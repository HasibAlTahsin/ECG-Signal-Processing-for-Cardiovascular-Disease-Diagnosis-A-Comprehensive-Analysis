# ECG Signal Processing for Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Analysis

Electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most critical diagnostic tools for identifying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of ECG signal processing methodologies, emphasizing noise reduction, feature extraction, and classification using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The ECG of Cardiac Ailments Dataset, consisting of 1,200 records from four categories—arrhythmia (ARR), atrial fibrillation (AFF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and normal sinus rhythm (NSR)—was employed for model evaluation. Feature extraction was performed using Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (MODWPT), which provides robust multi-resolution analysis. The classification models evaluated include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The LSTM model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 95.1%, outperforming CNN (93.5%) and SVM (87.2%). Comparative analysis with recent studies validates our findings, and we propose future research directions, including hybrid AI architectures, real-time monitoring, and edge computing optimizations.
